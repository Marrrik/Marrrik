Hi, I’m Mark 👋

ML Engineer / Data Scientist focused on production machine learning systems.

I work with end-to-end ML: from data collection and feature engineering to model deployment, monitoring, and iteration.
My background includes fintech credit risk models, anomaly detection in industrial data, OCR, time series forecasting, and NLP.

Currently interested in building reliable ML pipelines, MLOps infrastructure, and scalable data systems.

🔧 Tech Stack

Python: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, PyTorch

ML / DL: gradient boosting, time series models, NLP (BERT, FinBERT)

Data: PostgreSQL, Oracle, ClickHouse, Hadoop

MLOps: Docker, Docker Compose, Kubeflow, MLflow, DVC, CI/CD

Orchestration & APIs: Airflow, FastAPI

Visualization: Power BI, Dash, Streamlit

📌 Selected Projects

End-to-end ML system for credit risk modeling (PD, LGD) with production deployment

Anomaly detection pipelines for industrial data (R&D, production monitoring)

Multi-source ETL system with time series forecasting and NLP sentiment analysis

ML-powered backend services with REST APIs and Telegram bots
