Hi, I’m Mark 👋

ML Engineer / Data Scientist focused on production machine learning systems.

I work with end-to-end ML: from data collection and feature engineering to model deployment, monitoring, and iteration. My background includes fintech credit risk models, anomaly detection in industrial data, OCR, time series forecasting, and NLP.

Currently interested in building reliable ML pipelines, MLOps infrastructure, and scalable data systems.

🔧 Tech Stack

• Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, PyTorch)
• ML / DL: gradient boosting, time series models, NLP (BERT, FinBERT)
• Data: PostgreSQL, Oracle, ClickHouse, Hadoop
• MLOps: Docker, Docker Compose, Kubeflow, MLflow, DVC, CI/CD
• Orchestration & APIs: Airflow, FastAPI
• Visualization: Power BI, Dash, Streamlit

📌 Selected Projects

• End-to-end ML system for credit risk modeling (PD, LGD) with production deployment
• Anomaly detection pipelines for industrial data (R&D, production monitoring)
• Multi-source ETL system with time series forecasting and NLP sentiment analysis
• ML-powered backend services with REST APIs and Telegram bots

(Details in pinned repositories ↓)

📊 What I care about

• Clean and reproducible ML experiments
• Reliable data pipelines
• Model interpretability and business metrics
• Production readiness over academic metrics
